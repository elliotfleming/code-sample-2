# Crawfinder

## Overview
This is a simple application for viewing and creating crawfish boil posts.
It was originally written during Codemkrs Super Challenge, the official 48 hour hackathon 
of Super Bowl XLVII in 2013. The theme of the hackathon was apps that help tourists in town 
for the Super Bowl get a taste of the real New Orleans. I've made a few more edits since then 
at the request of people who actually ended up using the app (We weren't counting on this at the time).

## Technical Overview
This version of the app is written using Codeigniter and Twitter Bootstrap v2, and as such, should be very simple to understand. 
We originally wrote the app in Backbone.js (since no one in the group had worked with it before). That 
one was somewhat of a dud and we wanted to have something presentable, so in the last several hours of the 
competition we all took a shot at writing it as quickly as possible in our most familiar language. This was 
my version, and the version that still exists at [crawfinder.com](http://crawfinder.com). All in all, it has 
about 8 hours (of which most were at the end of a two day stetch with no sleep) of work put into it, so it's 
not pretty by any stretch. Nor is Codeigniter very elegant in the first place.

## Requirements
